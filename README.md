Welcome ðŸ‘‹

`npm install -g go-ios` can be used to get going. Run `ios --help` after the installation for details. 
For iOS 17+ devices you need to run `sudo ios tunnel start` for go ios to work. This will start a tunnel daemon. 
To make this work on Windows, download the latest wintun.dll from here `https://git.zx2c4.com/wintun` and copy it to `C:/Windows/system32`

The goal of this project is to provide a stable and production ready opensource solution to automate iOS device on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. I am delighted to announce that a few companies including [headspin.io](https://www.headspin.io/) and [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) will use or are using go-iOS. 

Follow my twitter for updates or check out my medium blog: https://daniel-paulus.medium.com/

If you are interested in using go-iOS please get in touch on LinkedIn, Twitter or the Github discussions above, I always love to hear what people are doing with it. 

If you miss something your Mac can do but go-iOS can't, just request a feature in the issues tab.
# New REST-API
Go-iOS is getting an experimental REST-API check it out [https://github.com/danielpaulus/go-ios/tree/main/restapi](https://github.com/danielpaulus/go-ios/tree/main/restapi) 

# Design principles:
1. Using golang to compile static, small and fast binaries for all platforms very easily. 
   
   *Build Manual*: Install golang and run `go build`
2. All output as JSON so you can easily use go-iOS from any other programming language
3. Everything is a module, you can use go-iOS in golang projects as a module dependency easily

# Features:
 Most notable:
 - Install apps zipped as ipa or unzipped from their .app folder `ios install --path=/path/to/app`
 - Run XCTests including WebdriverAgent on Linux, Windows and Mac
 - Start and Stop apps
 - Use a debug proxy to reverse engineer every tool Mac OSX has, so you can contrib to go-ios or build      your own
 - Pair devices without manual tapping on a popup
 - Install developer images automatically by running `ios image auto`
 - Set thermal states and network emulation on the device with the `ios devicestate` command

All features:

```
Options:
  -v --verbose              Enable Debug Logging.
  -t --trace                Enable Trace Logging (dump every message).
  --nojson                  Disable JSON output
  --pretty                  Pretty-print JSON command output
  -h --help                 Show this screen.
  --udid=<udid>             UDID of the device.
  --tunnel-info-port=<port> When go-ios is used to manage tunnels for iOS 17+ it exposes them on an HTTP-API for localhost (default port: 28100)
  --address=<ipv6addrr>     Address of the device on the interface. This parameter is optional and can be set if a tunnel created by MacOS needs to be used.
  >                         To get this value run "log stream --debug --info --predicate 'eventMessage LIKE "*Tunnel established*" OR eventMessage LIKE "*for server port*"'",
  >                         connect a device and open Xcode
  --rsd-port=<port>         Port of remote service discovery on the device through the tunnel
  >                         This parameter is similar to '--address' and can be obtained by the same log filter
  --proxyurl=<url>          Set this if you want go-ios to use a http proxy for outgoing requests, like for downloading images or contacting Apple during device activation.
  >                         A simple format like: "http://PROXY_LOGIN:PROXY_PASS@proxyIp:proxyPort" works. Otherwise use the HTTP_PROXY system env var.
  --userspace-port=<port>   Optional. Set this if you run a command supplying rsd-port and address and your device is using userspace tunnel

The commands work as following:
	The default output of all commands is JSON. Should you prefer human readable outout, specify the --nojson option with your command.
	By default, the first device found will be used for a command unless you specify a --udid=some_udid switch.
	Specify -v for debug logging and -t for dumping every message.
